This project is a fork of [PyHTK](https://github.com/danijel3/PyHTK). 

PyHTK contains a Python implementation of the MFCC features as computed by HTK.

CppHTK, a badly named fork, adds a c++ implementation that is similar to the python implementation of PyHTK.
Notice that for most use cases, you would probably want to use the HTK toolkit directly.


## How to use
1. See build instructions [here](https://github.com/metate/PyHTK/blob/master/cpp/README.md).
2. Read the instructions of [PyHTK](https://github.com/danijel3/PyHTK).
